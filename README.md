# Gallery App

- API-Driven React Application

Built a React web application that fetches and displays gallery data from external APIs. Implemented useEffect to manage side effects, handled dependency arrays for controlled re-renders, used cleanup functions for timers and event listeners, and applied best practices for asynchronous operations within React Hooks.
